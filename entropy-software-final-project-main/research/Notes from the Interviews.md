# Notes from the Interviews

Target Audience: People who use computer keyboards
This is a transcription of my paper notes, which I took during the video calls, and what I can remember. I was focused more on what I could learn than what the answers were, but I have tried my best to recreate them. My notes have been included into the presentation.
