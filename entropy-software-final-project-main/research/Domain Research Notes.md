# Domain Research  Notes

## Monkeytype.com

Browser based typing tester with several different variations of typing available. It is primarily based around testing and retesting typing styles. It is made primarily for users who have experience typing and presents a tool for them to improve their typing abilities through.

#### The Good:

- Primarily a typing tester
- Different functionalities and variations of typing characters and modes (ascii characters, only numbers, only directional keys, etc.)
- Based around testing typing speed, retesting, and tracking improvement
- Highly user customizeable (user can choose ads, size, types of words, dictionary it takes words from)
- has a command line interface
- Allows users to create different accounts which they can save their typing data across different browsers and platforms, appear on a leaderboard, and save their profiles across browsers
- Can be accessed from various different browsers

#### The Bad:

- No syntax typing for code in C(++) or Python
- No application ability for Windows
- Limited graphical features
- Difficult to learn on, no instructions for beginner users

## Master Gecko Typing Tutor

This is the typing software I learned to type on growing up. It was an application for Windows, teaching people how to type under the tutelage of Master Gecko, a typing master who ran a typing dojo. The game used humor and physical comedy, as well as the tropes of karate movies to encourage and reward its students on their journeys to typing excellence.

#### The Good:

- The comedy and the insanity of it, of a teacher of typing doing karate moves while a person is typing, is insane enough to keep even the unruliest of children to pay attention enough to learn the tenets of typing
- It includes several different typing exercises to teach new typers how to type, a game to strengthen these skills, and a  graduation process for basic typing literacy.

#### The Bad:

- The typing tutor game has no online function, and is not playable on modern machines
- No account functionality
- No memberships
- Poor typing exercises for tenkeys and special characters
- You learn one hand at once instead of two hands, which may not be the most recent way of learning touch typing
- The funny animations can be distracting, or provide stigma to adults learning to type
- It leads to poor retention and skill loss with little room for playability or retesting beyond learning
- No typing function to test speed or accuracy after the original setup and learning, or to learn words which are new or difficult combinations
- No code mode

## TypingTest.com

This is a stock standard typing test, and a bare test as far as I can tell. It is the stock standard for typing tests, adn seems to rely mostly upon regular word typing speed.

#### The Good:

- Provides accurate speed counts for the typing stock standard english words and passages
- Allows for some customization of the time and the difficulty
- Training mode with lessons allows the player to learn keys anew
- Various games and functionalities are linked to on the sidebar, like a racing game and a boating game, as well as a typing mode for job assessment

#### The Bad:

- Riddled with ads
- Less customization than Monkeytype
- The website seems almost low effort in some of its graphics - almost as if it is made of clipart and without artistic direction
- The class seems diminuitive and short
- Low responsivity
- No ability to create an account
- No application client, although I doubt I would want one if it were offered
- It feels engineered to extract money from the user
